## Hello! ##

I am currently an A-level student who is keen to learn as many aspects of programming as possible! I learnt to code in Python, and then Micropython. My current goal is learning to program in C for embedded systems (I mainly use the ESP32 platform at the moment).

### Current Projects: ###

Currently I am working on two main things:
 - ESP32-based autonomous UAV flight control system
      - I'm aiming to build as much of the code stack myself as possible. All sensor drivers are written and working (see my repositories), some of which are also C modules that can be compiled into ESP32 firmware.
      - Currently, I'm working on the sensor fusion algorithms to provide the Navigation for my UAV, as well as some aspects of the Guidance code. This will be posted here as a repository when I have a working navigation system!
 - The software/hardware for an ultrasonic microphone jammer
     - You can see the repository for the simulation code I wrote to simulate this idea (more details in the repo)
     - Currently, I'm working on the hardware design for this project - more details to come!
