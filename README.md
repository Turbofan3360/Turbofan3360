##  :wave: Hello! ##

I am a Year 13 A Level student with a strong interest in embedded systems and other real-world applications for my code, such as simulation. I work in Python and C (currently focusing on the ESP32 platform), and enjoy applying theoretical concepts from maths and physics to real-world challenges.

### Current Projects: ###

Currently I am working on two main things:
 - ESP32 based autonomous UAV flight control system
      - Aiming to build as much of the code stack myself as possible
      - Have developed C embedded firmware to drive sensors such as GPS, Magnetometer and Barometer
      - Currently I'm working on sensor fusion algorithms for UAV navigation, as well as aspects of the guidance logic
      - GOAL: To produce an open-source ESP32 flight control software capable of autonomous flight
      
 - Software/hardware for an ultrasonic microphone jammer
     - Developed Python code to simulate the ultrasound intereference patterns, used to help with hardware design
     - Currently, I'm working on the hardware design for this project - more details to come.

### Future Project Ideas: ###
- Learn VHDL to program for FPGAs
- Machine Vision UAV Obstacle Avoidance

 ### Interests: ###

 - :rocket: Aerospace technologies (particularly spaceflight & civilian uses for autonomous UAVs)
 - ⚛️ Physics
 - 🧪 STEM outreach

Feel free to get in touch!
